# RobotCar Project

Welcome to the RobotCar project! This repository contains all the necessary resources, code, and documentation to build and operate a robotic car.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Remote control via a mobile app
- Integration with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared)
- Modular and extensible design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Motors and motor driver
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, IR)
- Power supply
- Basic programming knowledge

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotcar.git
    ```
2. Follow the hardware setup instructions in the [Hardware Guide](docs/HARDWARE.md).
3. Install the required software dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Upload the firmware to your microcontroller.
2. Run the control software:
